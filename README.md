## NBA Dataset Abstract

This analysis is meant to look at how team statistiscs, like total points and rebounds, changed over time. Additionally, I wanted to look at how a draft prospect's position, weight and height changed. Basically, I will look at a player's weight, height and position during the draft and compare it to the same things in the current season.

## Mental Health in Tech Abstract
